# PCA_2_components

Jupyter notebook for Principal component analysis (PCA).

> *PCA is used in [exploratory data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis
> "Exploratory data analysis") and for making predictive
> models (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_modeling "Predictive
> modeling"). It is commonly used for dimensionality
> reduction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction
> "Dimensionality reduction") by projecting each data point onto only
> the first few principal components to obtain lower-dimensional data
> while preserving as much of the data's variation as possible.*

### Using this notbook:

 - Create the environment from the environment.yml file:
 `conda env create -f environment.yml`

 - This will create an envitroment called:
`PCA2D`

- Activate the newly created enviroment with:
 `conda activate PCA2D`

- Run jupyter-lab
`jupyter lab`

Things most likely will break due to `Jupyter widgets`  if that is the case follow the installation guide here:
